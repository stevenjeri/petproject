   <p>My favorite pet is a dog. I love dogs because they are
    friendly and cute. They are also loyal to their owners. But most
    of all, they can be a great friend when I am lonely. Dogs are
    wonderful pets.</p>

    <h2>Characteristics of a dog</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>They’re so adorable, obviously</li>
        <li>They are always the first to comfort you</li>
        <li>Friendship</li>
        <li> increase your mood!</li> 
        <li>Dogs keep us happy and healthy</li>

    </ul>

  <p><strong>Dogs</strong> are great friends when you are lonely. They can
    sense when you’re down and even do tricks to cheer you up.
    My dog usually<em>licks me on my nose when I am crying</em>. A treat is
    always a good way to say thank you to your dog. When you are
    lonely, you can always count on your pet.</p>

    <p class="line1">I love dogs because they are friendly and cute. When I
        look at their big, beautiful eyes, I just melt like ice cream on a
        hot summer day.</p>

        <p id="line2">Dogs are not only adorable; they are also loyal to their
            owners.</p>
